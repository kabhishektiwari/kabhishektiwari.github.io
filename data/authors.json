    "bio": ["<p>'Some ideas only become clear after they pass through language.'</p>", "<p>I write because some thoughts refuse to stay quiet. They linger, return, and insist on being shaped into words. At times, this urge becomes a short story, at times a reflective blog, and at other moments a response to what is unfolding in society, politics, or international relations. Writing, for me, is not an act of display but of understanding—an attempt to make sense of experiences, events, and ideas before they fade into noise.</p><p> Along with being the author, I also manage this website myself. There is no separation between the writer and the space it lives in. What you read here is directly shaped by my curiosity, opinions, and questions about society, politics, relationships, and change. I do not aim to sound authoritative; I aim to be clear, thoughtful, and honest.</p>"],
